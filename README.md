## Introduction ✏️

The Space Cat is a fundamentally simple but challenging, cross-platform GUI desktop
application. The Space Cat game was created using the Qt Creator and C++ programming
language and various Qt modules such as Qt GraphicScene and Qt PropertyAnimation. This
game is based on a basic strategy of flying across space without getting hit and burned by
comets and meteoroids that cross paths with the Space Cat's journey along the way.

## Functionalities 🪄

* Finish the game once the user hits a comet
* Provide an ‘About Me’ section to view the game details

## Supported Platforms 💻
